## Project Overview

This dissertation investigates the relationship between financial news sentiment and the daily price volatility of two types of exchange-traded funds (ETFs): the Invesco Solar ETF (TAN), representing a niche renewable energy sector, and the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), representing the broader market.

The artefact demonstrates how Natural Language Processing (NLP), econometric modeling, and quantitative backtesting can be combined into a modular Python-based system to assess sentiment-volatility interactions and test a simple trading strategy.

## Dissertation Objectives

- Extract and quantify financial sentiment from news headlines using the VADER model.
- Model and compare ETF volatility using GARCH and rolling standard deviation.
- Evaluate the correlation and predictive relationship between sentiment and volatility.
- Design and backtest a rules-based trading strategy informed by sentiment signals.

## IT Artefact Overview

This project implements a modular Python-based artefact designed to:

- Collect and store historical ETF price data and financial news  
- Apply sentiment analysis to daily headlines using VADER  
- Model price volatility using rolling standard deviation and GARCH  
- Evaluate sentiment-volatility relationships using regression analysis  
- Backtest a rules-based trading strategy  
- Log all activities to ensure transparency and reproducibility

## Logging
This project uses a reusable logging utility (`logger.py`) that stores log output in the `logs/` folder.
Logs include timestamps, severity level, and message content to support debugging and traceability.
