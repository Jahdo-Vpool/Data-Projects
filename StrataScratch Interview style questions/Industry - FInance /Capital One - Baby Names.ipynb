    "\n",
    "- Data Limitations & Distortions:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Exclusion of Uncommon Names: The most significant limitation is that names with fewer than 5 occurrences in a given state and year are completely omitted. This distorts the data by over-representing popular names and making it impossible to study the \"long tail\" of rare or unique names.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Inaccurate National Aggregates: As a direct result of the first point, summing the state data will not produce an accurate national count. The true national total for any name will be higher than what can be calculated from these files.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. Source-Related Bias: The data is sourced exclusively from Social Security records. This means individuals born before the widespread adoption of Social Security in the mid-1930s, or those who never received a Social Security Number for other reasons, are not included. This particularly impacts the reliability of the data for the earliest years in the dataset."
