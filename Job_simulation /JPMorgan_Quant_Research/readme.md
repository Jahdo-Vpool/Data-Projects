# Task One - Natural Gas Storage Contract Pricing

## Purpose

I am completing this simulation as a Quantitative Researcher supporting a commodity trading desk. The goal is to improve the quality of natural gas market data so that the desk can accurately price natural gas storage contracts.

## What I'm Doing

- Extrapolating external market data feeds to create a more granular dataset.
- Analyzing seasonal trends in natural gas prices (e.g., how prices vary month-to-month).
- Estimating future gas prices using historical data and seasonal patterns.
- Supporting contract pricing strategies where gas is purchased during low-price months (e.g., summer) and sold during high-price months (e.g., winter).

## Why This Matters

Natural gas storage contracts are agreements between storage facility owners and clients (e.g., producers, refiners, distributors, trading firms) that allow a specific quantity of gas to be stored for a defined period.

Key contract terms include:

- **Injection date** – when gas is purchased and stored
- **Withdrawal date** – when gas is removed and sold
- **Storage fees** and **operational limits**

Clients often use these contracts to take advantage of seasonal price differentials. For example, purchasing gas during summer (lower prices) and selling it during winter (higher prices) can generate profit—if supported by reliable pricing models and forecasts.

## Deliverables

- A cleaned and granular dataset derived from external feeds
- Seasonal analysis of historical natural gas prices
- A model to estimate future prices for use in contract valuation
